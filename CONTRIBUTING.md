Detailed conventions and policies to write, test, and maintain Optuna code are described in
the [Optuna Wiki](https://github.com/optuna/optuna/wiki).

- [Coding Style Conventions](https://github.com/optuna/optuna/wiki/Coding-Style-Conventions)
- [Deprecation Policy](https://github.com/optuna/optuna/wiki/Deprecation-policy)
- [Test Policy](https://github.com/optuna/optuna/wiki/Test-Policy)

### Setup Optuna-Integration

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_NAME/optuna-integration.git
cd optuna-integration
pip install -e .
```

### Checking the Format, Coding Style, and Type Hints

Code is formatted with [black](https://github.com/psf/black),
and docstrings are formatted with [blackdoc](https://github.com/keewis/blackdoc).
Coding style is checked with [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org) and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/),
and additional conventions are described in the [Wiki](https://github.com/optuna/optuna/wiki/Coding-Style-Conventions).
Type hints, [PEP484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/), are checked with [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/).

```bash
$ pip install ".[checking]"
# black and isort format
$ black .
$ isort .

# flake8 type checking
$ flake8 tests optuna/integration

# mypy type checking
$ mypy tests optuna/integration 
```

### Documentation

When adding a new feature to the framework, you also need to document it in the reference.

The Optuna-Integration document is still in the Optuna document, if you want to
add to it, please see the
[documentation section of](https://github.com/optuna/optuna/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#documentation)
the Optuna repository.

### Unit Tests

When adding a new feature or fixing a bug, you also need to write sufficient test code.
We use [pytest](https://pytest.org/) as the testing framework and
unit tests are stored under the [tests directory](./tests).

Please install some required packages at first.

```bash
# Install required packages to test.
pip install ".[test]"

# Install required packages on which integration modules depend.
pip install ".[all]"
```

You can run your tests as follows:

```bash
# Run all the unit tests.
pytest

# Run all the unit tests defined in the specified test file.
pytest tests/${TARGET_TEST_FILE_NAME}

# Run the unit test function with the specified name defined in the specified test file.
pytest tests/${TARGET_TEST_FILE_NAME} -k ${TARGET_TEST_FUNCTION_NAME}
```

See also the [Optuna Test Policy](https://github.com/optuna/optuna/wiki/Test-Policy), which describes the principles to
write and maintain Optuna tests to meet certain quality requirements.

### Continuous Integration and Local Verification

Optuna-Integration repository uses GitHub Actions.

### Creating a Pull Request

When you are ready to create a pull request, please try to keep the following in mind.

First, the **title** of your pull request should:

- briefly describe and reflect the changes
- wrap any code with backticks
- not end with a period

*The title will be directly visible in the release notes.*

For example:

- Support multi-objective optimization in MLflowCallback.

Second, the **description** of your pull request should:

- describe the motivation
- describe the changes
- if still work-in-progress, describe remaining tasks
